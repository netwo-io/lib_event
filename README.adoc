==  Event recording for auditability for PostgreSQL (PL/pgSQL)


=== Features

- [x] unrestricted event name
- [x] user-defined headers
- [x] handles payload of any-size

=== Convention

An `event` is something that has happened. In the past.

Event should be in the form of: `<service>.<resourceType>.<verb_past_tense>`

Examples:
- `iam.user.created`
- `billing.invoice.drafted`
- `billing.invoice.paid`


=== Usage

=== API

(function) create a new event (event_id), insert it (table lib_event.event) and trigger a pg_notify("lib_event.created", event_id)

```
lib_events.create("iam.user.created", payload jsonb, ...)
```

pg_notify limits payload to 8000 bytes so lib_event only contains the event_id that can then be retrieved with

```
select * from lib_events.events where event__id = XXXX
```


(view) public access to one or more events

```
select event__id, headers, payload from lib_events.events;
```
